# Puppeteer Script - Swap Defillama

This repository contains a Puppeteer script for automating tasks on the Swap Defillama website. The task was done for Orange Labs as a part of
intern hiring process.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swap-defillama-puppeteer.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd swap-defillama-puppeteer

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install


## Usage

To run the script and automate tasks on the Swap Defillama website, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start

### This will launch a Puppeteer-controlled browser and execute the script.

Note: By default, the browser window will be visible during script execution. If you prefer to run the script in headless mode (without displaying the browser window), you can modify the headless option in the script.

Follow the script execution in the opened browser window. The script will perform various automated tasks on the Swap Defillama website.

#### Once the script completes its tasks, you can manually interact with the browser or close it.

## Remember to install the dependencies by running npm install before running the script.
